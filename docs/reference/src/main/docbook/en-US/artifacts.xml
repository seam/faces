	<title>Faces Artifact Injection</title>
   <para>
      One of the goals of the Seam Faces Module is to make support for CDI a more ubiquitous experience, by
      allowing injection of JSF Lifecycle Artifacts into managed beans, and also by providing support for
      @Inject where it would not normally be available. This section describes the additional CDI integration
      for faces artifact injection

      <title>@*Scoped and @Inject in Validators and Converters</title>
      <para>
         Frequently when performing complex validation, it is necessary to access data stored in a database
         or in other contextual objects within the application itself. JSF does not, by default, provide
         support for <literal>@Inject</literal> in Converters and Validators, but Seam Faces makes this 
         available. In addition to injection, it is sometimes convenient to be able to scope a validator
         just as we would scope a managed bean; this feature is also added by Seam Faces.
      </para>
      <para>
         Notice how the Validator below is actually <literal>@RequestScoped</literal>, in addition to using
         injection to obtain an instance of the <literal>UserService</literal> with which to perform an email
         database lookup. 
      </para>
      <programlisting role="JAVA"><![CDATA[@RequestScoped
@FacesValidator("emailAvailabilityValidator")
public class EmailAvailabilityValidator implements Validator
{
   @Inject
   UserService us;

   @Override
   public void validate(final FacesContext context, final UIComponent component, final Object value)
            throws ValidatorException
   {
      String field = value.toString();
      try
      {
         us.getUserByEmail(field);
         FacesMessage msg = new FacesMessage("That email address is unavailable");
         throw new ValidatorException(msg);
      }
      catch (NoSuchObjectException e)
      {
      }
   }
}]]></programlisting>
      <warning>
         <para>
            We recommend to always use <literal>@RequestScoped</literal> converters/validators unless a
            longer scope is required, in which case you should use the appropriate scope annotation, but
            it should not be omitted.
         </para>
         <para>   
            Because of the way JSF persists Validators between requests, particularly when using 
            <literal>@Inject</literal> inside a validator or converter, forgetting to use a 
            <literal>@*Scoped</literal> annotation could in fact cause <literal>@Inject</literal>'ed
            objects to become null.
         </para>

   {

   }

      <title>@Inject'able Faces Artifacts</title>
      	<para>
      		This is the list of inject-able artifacts provided through Seam Faces. These objects would
               normally require static method-calls in order to obtain handles, but Seam Faces attempts
               to break that coupling by providing @Inject'able artifacts. This means it will be possible
               to more easily provide mocked objects during unit and integration testing, and also simplify
               bean code in the application itself.
