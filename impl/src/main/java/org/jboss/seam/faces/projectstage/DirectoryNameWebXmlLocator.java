/**
 * <p>
 * This implementation of {@link WebXmlLocator} will try to identify the location of <code>web.xml</code> by searching for a
 * known resource on the classpath and trying to find the <code>WEB-INF</code> directory in its path name. This will typically
 * work if the known resource in located in a JAR file inside the <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> directory.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Compared to {@link URLClassLoaderWebXmlLocator} this implementation works fine even for containers like JBoss AS6 and AS7.
